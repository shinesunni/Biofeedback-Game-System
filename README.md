###### Author's note: ######
Bio-Feedback Game System written in completely Verilog. The game is designed for Nexys 4 DDR FPGA board,
VGA display, and USB Keyboard. However the following youtube demo is not the final build but represents
fully of what our senior project design is based. The game was based on a "Space Invader/Galaga" gameplay.

The purpose of our senior project design is to include the user's heartbeat as part of the mechanic of the
gameplay to create immersion, and put on a playful spin of having the game adjust difficulty depending on
heartbeat. The game is more difficult if the user is not able to maintain a lower heart rate which 80 BPM is
the baseline of difficult gameplay.

Iterations of our Senior Design:

DEMO 1: No game but, heartbeat display on FPGA board.

DEMO 2: Cube moving on screen.

DEMO 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m32V9zb9Nc (bonus boss footage)

DEMO 4: Sound implementation, Game v2.0

DEMO 5: Final Build (Fully working with Heartbeat monitor)

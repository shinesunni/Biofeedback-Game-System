The long awaited test files are here to have you something to work with.

These are provided to have something you can work with to have a game similar or different from our build. 

Remember to give where credit is due. 

The following files are version_1 of the build. We had 17 iterations of our game. Unfortunatly we didn't know version control because they never taught us it at school! HAHA

But all 17 versions are on my computer. And if you ask nicely, I may show you some bits of it.
